## Technical Architecture

### Implementation Approach
ZooBase is built as a modern web application with React for the frontend and Node.js for the backend, emphasizing real-time data capabilities. The architecture focuses on providing immediate updates for animal tracking, health monitoring, and staff collaboration while ensuring a responsive experience across devices.

### System Components
1. **Client Layer**: React-based frontend with responsive design and offline capabilities
2. **API Gateway**: Central entry point handling authentication, routing, and request validation
3. **WebSocket Server**: Manages real-time connections and broadcasts updates
4. **Core Services**: Modular services for animal management, medical records, location tracking, notifications, and analytics
5. **Data Layer**: MongoDB for persistent storage with Redis for caching and real-time data distribution

### Technology Stack

#### Frontend
- React 18+ with Hooks and Context API
- Redux Toolkit for global state management
- React Query for server state management
- Socket.IO client for real-time communication
- Tailwind CSS for styling (based on configuration files)
- React Router for navigation

#### Backend
- Node.js with Express.js
- Socket.IO for real-time communication
- JWT for authentication
- MongoDB with Mongoose ODM
- Redis for caching and as a pub/sub broker
- Elasticsearch for advanced search capabilities

#### Database
- MongoDB as the primary database
- Redis for caching and real-time data
- Elasticsearch for search functionality

## API Structure and Data Models

### REST API Endpoints
The application has a comprehensive API structure with endpoints for all core functionalities including:
- Animal management (CRUD operations)
- Medical records management
- Location tracking
- Feeding schedules
- User management and authentication
- Reporting and analytics

### WebSocket Events
The system uses WebSocket events for real-time communications, including:
- Animal status updates
- Location tracking broadcasts
- Health alert notifications
- Staff activity updates
- Feeding schedule notifications

### Key Data Models
The application has well-defined data models including:

#### Animal
- _id: ObjectId
- name: string
- species: string
- taxon: object
- identifiers: object
- dateOfBirth: Date
- sex: string
- status: string
- location: ObjectId (reference)
- medicalRecords: Array<ObjectId>
- feeding: object

#### MedicalRecord
- _id: ObjectId
- animalId: ObjectId (reference)
- date: Date
- veterinarianId: ObjectId (reference)
- type: string
- description: string
- treatment: string
- medications: Array
- notes: string

## Code Organization

The project follows a standard React application structure with clear separation of concerns:

- **components/**: Reusable UI components
- **pages/**: Page-level components with routing
- **services/**: API communication and external services
- **store/**: Redux state management
- **socket/**: WebSocket connection management
- **utils/**: Utility functions and helpers
- **context/**: React context providers

## Development Guidelines and Collaboration

### Development Standards
- Code linting with ESLint for consistent code style
- Use of TypeScript for type safety
- Component-based architecture following React best practices
- Service-oriented backend structure

### Development Workflow
- Feature branch workflow with Git
- Pull request reviews before merging
- Continuous integration with automated testing
- Regular deployments to staging environment

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for individual components and services
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- End-to-end tests for critical user flows
- Performance testing for real-time capabilities

## Recommendations for Multiple Developers Collaboration

### Version Control Best Practices
- Use feature branches for all development work
- Create pull requests for code reviews before merging to main branch
- Write meaningful commit messages following conventional commits pattern
- Regularly pull from the main branch to minimize merge conflicts

### Code Standards and Consistency
- Follow ESLint configurations for consistent code style
- Use TypeScript interfaces for component props and state
- Document complex logic with clear comments
- Follow React best practices for component structure and hooks usage

### Communication and Coordination
- Maintain up-to-date task tracking in a project management system
- Schedule regular sync meetings for cross-team dependencies
- Document API changes and communicate to affected team members
- Establish clear ownership areas while maintaining shared knowledge

## Setup and Environment

The project uses Vite as the build tool and package manager (likely pnpm based on lock file). To set up the development environment:

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies with `pnpm install`
3. Run the development server with `pnpm dev`
4. Build for production with `pnpm build`

## Conclusion

ZooBase is a comprehensive, modern web application designed for zoo management with strong real-time capabilities. The project has a well-structured architecture using React and Node.js with Socket.IO for real-time communications. The codebase is organized following industry best practices and includes clear guidelines for collaboration among multiple developers.

As development continues, the team should focus on maintaining code quality through consistent standards, thorough testing, and clear communication. Special attention should be given to the real-time aspects of the application, as these are critical to its functionality and may present unique scaling challenges as noted in the design documentation.
